INTRODUCTION                                    *bottom-term*

This plugin provides a simple way to toggle a terminal window at the bottom
of your Vim session. The terminal can be opened and closed with a single
command or keybinding.

COMMANDS                                        *bottom-term-commands*

                                                *:RunBottomTerm*
:RunBottomTerm          Opens a terminal window at the bottom of the screen,
                        resized to 15 lines. If a terminal is already open,
                        this command has no effect.

                                                *:CloseBottomTerm*
:CloseBottomTerm        Closes the bottom terminal window. The terminal
                        buffer is also removed from the buffer list.

                                                *:ToggleBottomTerm*
:ToggleBottomTerm       Toggles the terminal window on/off. This is the
                        recommended way to interact with the plugin.

MAPPINGS                                        *bottom-term-mappings*

                                                *bottom-term-<F2>*
<F2>                    Toggle the terminal window on/off.
                        Maps to :ToggleBottomTerm

                        You can create your own mapping:
                        >
                            nnoremap <leader>t :ToggleBottomTerm<CR>
                        <

CONFIGURATION                                   *bottom-term-configuration*

                                                *g:bottom_term_auto_open*
g:bottom_term_auto_open

    Set this to 1 in your vimrc to automatically open the bottom terminal
    when Vim starts:
    >
        let g:bottom_term_auto_open = 1
    <
    Default: 0 (disabled)

FEATURES                                        *bottom-term-features*

- Single terminal instance: Only one terminal exists at any time. Pressing
  F2 multiple times won't create duplicates
- Session persistence: Closing the terminal keeps your shell session alive.
  Reopening with F2 returns to the same session
- Smart terminal detection: Reuses existing terminal buffer
- Automatic state synchronization: Handles manual terminal closure
- Error handling: Gracefully handles failures
- No confirmation prompts: Terminal closes immediately without asking
  for confirmation when toggling with F2 or :ToggleBottomTerm
- Auto-cleanup on exit: Terminal is automatically closed on :qa or :q
  without blocking, so you can exit Vim smoothly

TROUBLESHOOTING                                 *bottom-term-troubleshooting*

If the terminal doesn't appear:
- Check that your Vim version supports |terminal| (Vim 8.1+ or Neovim)
- Try running `:term` manually to see if terminals work

If multiple terminals appear:
- This shouldn't happen with the improved code, but you can manually close
  extra terminals with |:bwipeout|
